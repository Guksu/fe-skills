## Screen comparisons

We gave Claude Code the requests below. One side had nothing installed. The other side had only suta installed. Model and settings were the same.

### Mobile webview: e-commerce

> Build the e-commerce screens for a mobile webview: home, product list, product detail, my page, cart, settings, and a GNB (bottom navigation). *(Translated from the original Korean request.)*

![Shopping app screens built from the same request. Top row without suta (AS-IS), bottom row with suta (TO-BE). From left: home, product list, product detail, cart, my page, settings](docs/assets/as-is-to-be.jpg)

From left: home, product list, product detail, cart, my page, settings. Captured at 390px wide. The food photos are credited in [Image credits](docs/assets/CREDITS.md).

We ran it once without suta and four times with suta 0.8. The bottom row is the third of the four runs. The table compares the two rows in the image.

| | Without suta | With suta |
|---|---|---|
| Color | Orange on the banner, categories, badges, stars and buttons | One brown accent. Only the discount rate is red |
| Icons | Emoji | Line icons of one size and stroke |
| Product cards | BEST, NEW and "popular" badges | Discount rate, price and rating |
| Home | No search field | A search field at the top |
| Detail bottom bar | Four controls: wish, quantity, add to cart, buy | Wish and Buy. Options and quantity are picked in a sheet that opens from Buy |
| Bottom tabs | The cart screen pins both the tab bar and the order button | Cart is an icon on the right of the header. Tabs are hidden on detail and cart |
| Accessibility violations (axe, 6 screens) | 111 color-contrast issues | 0 |

All four suta runs included a home search field, a cart icon in the header and a purchase sheet, and hid the bottom tabs on detail and cart screens. Three used a dark green accent, and the axe accessibility checker found 0 to 2 violations per run. Generation time increased from 2.3 minutes to 5 to 7 minutes. See the [method and per-run results](docs/research/2026-10-08-commerce-webview.md) (Korean).

### Desktop: stock trading website

> Build a stock trading platform website. It needs home (market overview), stock detail (chart, order book, order), my assets, watchlist, search, trade history, settings and a GNB. *(Translated from the original Korean request.)*

![Stock trading websites built from the same request. Top row without suta (AS-IS), bottom row with suta (TO-BE). Left: home, right: stock detail](docs/assets/securities-as-is-to-be.jpg)

Left is the home screen, right is the stock detail screen, captured at 1440px wide. Stock names and prices are sample data.

We ran it four times without suta and twice with suta 0.10. The image shows the first run of each condition. The table covers all 7 screens.

| | Without suta (4 runs) | With suta 0.10 (2 runs) |
|---|---|---|
| Accessibility violations (axe, 1440px) | 63 to 277, mostly color contrast | 0 |
| Rising-price color | `#e8383d` and similar, 4.1:1 contrast on white | `#d0262d`, at least 4.5:1 contrast |
| Order button within the first screen | 2 of 4 runs | Both runs |
| Search field in the header | All 4 runs | Both runs (with a `/` shortcut hint) |
| Fixed sell/buy bar on the mobile stock detail | None | Both runs |
| Generation time and cost | 3 to 4.4 minutes, $0.54 to $0.75 | 7.4 to 14.5 minutes, $1.51 to $1.72 |

Two models compared 14 pairs of screens without knowing which used suta. Each pair was shown twice with the order reversed. The judges selected suta in 23 and 24 of their 28 comparisons. One judge was the same model used to generate the screens. These model judgments on a small sample do not establish a general quality difference.

Version 0.10 added order panel and search field placement guidelines based on 10 stock trading websites. See the [stock trading website study](docs/research/2026-10-09-securities-web.md) (Korean) for the method and comparison with the previous version.

## How it works

The agent reads the [skill document](skills/suta/SKILL.md) for the workflow and layout, color and motion guidelines. These cover reducing repetitive cards, unnecessary decoration and inconsistent spacing and type sizes, and choosing a layout suited to the screen's purpose.

The [56 patterns](skills/suta/patterns/) include documentation and code for bottom sheets, bottom tabs, toasts and other UI. The agent copies the code it needs into the project. Pattern code requires no additional runtime libraries. The implementation guidelines also cover keyboard use, screen readers and reduced motion.

When installed as a plugin, suta checks layout and motion after edits and reports issues on changed lines to the agent. The skill and pattern documentation are written in Korean. One recorded check used an English request and produced English UI copy and a reply in English.

## Installation

Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add Guksu/suta
/plugin install suta@suta
```

In Codex, approve suta's post-edit check in `/hooks` after installing.

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add Guksu/suta
codex plugin add suta@suta
```

Other agents such as Cursor, Gemini CLI and GitHub Copilot install the skill only. The post-edit check does not run there.

```bash
npx skills add Guksu/suta --skill suta
```

The install script, install folders and moving from the old version are in the [full guide, "Installation"](docs/guide.en.md#installation).

## Usage

After installation, ask for a task such as "build a login screen" or "polish this button animation". The agent uses suta to select the relevant patterns.

You can try the 56 patterns in the [live demo](https://guksu.github.io/suta/). The list is in the [full guide](docs/guide.en.md#56-patterns).

## Benchmark

Requests for eight screen types—detail, form, settings, dashboard, landing, cart, list and interaction—were run twice per condition. The table shows round 2 results: browser measurements of pages generated with suta 0.6.0 and without suta.

| 16 pages per condition | Without suta | With suta 0.6.0 |
|---|---|---|
| Accessibility violations (axe, total) | 87 | 13 |
| Boxes nested in boxes (total) | 41 | 1 |
| Gradients, blurs, large shadows (total) | 47 | 0 |
| Touch targets under 24px (total) | 27 | 0 |
| Pages with text under 12px | 4 | 0 |
| Pages that scroll sideways at 320px | 2 | 0 |
| Pages whose primary button is blue, indigo or violet | 10 | 0 |

The table includes both accessibility findings and counts of decorative elements. Fewer colors or decorations alone do not establish better design quality.

In comparisons with the installation condition hidden, two judge models selected suta in 11 and 19 of 32 comparisons. One judge was the same model used to generate the screens; neither chose a tie. Their preferences differed, so the results did not establish a visual preference for either condition.

Median generation time per page increased from 61 to 103 seconds. See the [benchmark document](docs/benchmark.en.md) for the method and full results.

## Limitations

- Experiments used one to four runs per condition. Results vary even with the same request.
- The rule values come from 1,104 screens of 31 Korean apps and 19 reference websites. Conventions elsewhere may differ.
- The agent reads more, so it takes longer and costs more. In the e-commerce test, 2.3 minutes and $0.39 became 5 to 7 minutes and $1.35 to $1.55.
- Static checks alone cannot reliably detect missing styles or unresponsive buttons. The UI still needs to be checked in a browser.
- Screen generation experiments used only Claude Code's default model.
